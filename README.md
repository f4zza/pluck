# MERN AI Image Generation App

This is a full-stack web application that uses artificial intelligence to generate new images based on user input. The app is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and leverages the power of deep learning to generate high-quality images in real-time.



## Features

- Type and send anything you can think of or use surprise me to get one image generated randomly
- Generate new images with just one click
- Save and view a history of generated images
- Download the generated images to your device


## How Does It Work?

The AI model behind this application has been trained on a large dataset of images and can generate new images based on the input image provided by the user. The model uses advanced deep learning algorithms to analyze the input image and generate new images that are similar in style and content.

The front-end of the application is built using React, allowing for a user-friendly interface that is easy to use. The back-end is built using Node.js and Express, and communicates with the AI model to generate the images and store the generated images in a MongoDB database.


## Setup

To set up the MERN AI Image Generation App, clone this repository and run the following command in the terminal to install the required packages:

`npm install`

Next, start the MongoDB server and run the following command to start the application:

`npm start`
    
The MERN AI Image Generation App will now be running on http://localhost:8080/.
